                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <h3>But what exactly SWC does?</h3>
                <p>It cleans temporary files by deleting all files in the three temporary files windows folder. The first one is the temp folder located in <strong>"C:\Windows\Temp"</strong>, the second temp folder located in <strong>"C:\Users\"YourUsername"\AppData\Local\Temp"</strong>, and the third folder is the prefetch folder located in <strong>"C:\Windows\Prefetch"</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Why delete temporary files?</h3>
                <p>Acording with the <a href="https://www.cu.edu" target="_blank">University of Colorado</a> "Too many temporary files can consume valuable storage space. These files accumulate over time and impact the memory available for your computer to run core processes.

                If youâ€™re running low on storage space, you should consider deleting your temp files to free up space that you can use for other files and data." 
                for more information, checkout the <a href="https://www.cu.edu/blog/tech-tips/improve-laptop-performance-deleting-temporary-files#:~:text=Too%20many%20temporary%20files%20can,for%20other%20files%20and%20data.">page who talks about this</a>.</p>
                <h3>It's safe delete all this files?</h3>
                <p>Yes it is, as said before, all files in these folders are unecessary files led by programs you use or install. If you still in doubt, check out a question about it in Microsoft's official website: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/ok-to-delete-temp-files/cba59ac9-ae9d-4a69-b745-1e538ffa8934" target="_blank">Answers.microsoft</a>. 
                </p>
                <h3>What else SWC can do?</h3>
                <p>Aside of  cleaning the temporary files, SWC can aslo run a disk cleanup to clean your local disk and free some storage space.
                This is all SWC can do in currently version <strong><a href="https://github.com/PHCavalcante/SWC_Simple_Windows_Cleaner/releases/tag/v1.1.0">v.1.1.0</a> </strong>, but in the future some new features will become avaliable.</p>
